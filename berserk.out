Looking for 1 s Fibonacci job.
Found 1st longer calculation (t = 1) and it's for n = 32.
We want to run a job for 0:00:03 (3 s).
Doing 3 runs of 32th Fibonacci number calculation
#estimation 0:00:03.146445.
#start 2012-11-06 14:33:12.311584
#end 2012-11-06 14:33:15.454622
Finished. It took: 3.14 s (0.05 min)
#runtime 0:00:03.143038 (3 s)
I am doing a dummy benchmark! Yeiii :)
